# opengl-portals
There are some rests in the repository from an older project. The relevant file is project.c; all code for the portals is in there. 

Please note that you requier "GLUtilities.H" and "MicroGlut.h" as well as Ingemar Ragnemalms "VectorUtils.h" and "loadobj.h" to build. 
If using Ingemar Ragnemalms "common"- folder, place both the project-folder and common in the same parent folder.

Use makefile to build. Designed to complile and run for Ubuntu Linux but adapt it as you wish.

Run the file "project" to run the program precompiled (Linux).
